# ASTKD-PCB-LDD:A Lightweight High Performance PCB Defect Detection Algorithm
In the realm of PCB defect detection, the need for models that combine high accuracy with lightweight architecture for efficient deployment on industrial platforms is increasingly critical. Our work directly addresses this need by proposing the ASTKD-PCB-LDD model, based on YOLOv5s,which significantly reduces computational requirements while enhancing detection accuracy and speed.

The code will be available upon publication
